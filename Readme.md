# Server-side rendering in React

Sample application to show server side rendering of a React application using an express server.

The idea is based on [this article](http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2016-09-16-react-server-side-rendering/).

## Development

```bash
yarn

yarn run webpack:server   # will run continuously to detect changes in jsx files
yarn start                # will start the express application

# go to http://localhost:3000
```
